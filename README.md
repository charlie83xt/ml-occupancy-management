# ML-Based Office Occupancy Management

This repository contains a demonstration of a machine learning-based solution developed to analyse and predict office occupancy levels using internal organisational data. The project was conducted as part of an academic research initiative and is intended to showcase the outcomes and structure of the solution.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning models can be used to understand and predict workplace occupancy by analysing the relationship between factors such as transport activity, weather conditions, and historical occupancy data.

The final output is a prototype system that supports space availability management through predictive analytics, as described in the accompanying academic report.
